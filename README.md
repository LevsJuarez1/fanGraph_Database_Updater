# Database Creator/Updater

What our project aims to achieve is to extract the most recent information on baseball players in Major League Baseball where we compare data of Right-handed players verses Left-handed players. We take pitching information and batting information and compile it into one database.

We take data of teams where we divide the statistics of pitchers and compare them with same-handed batters or opposited-handed batters, depending on which hand is dominant.
